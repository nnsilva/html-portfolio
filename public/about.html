<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<h2>My Name is Natalia (:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Full-stack web developer</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic about life, married for 16 years, and a proud mother of two (a 10-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son). I am dedicated to achieving outstanding results through adaptive approaches and
  fostering respectful, long-term partnerships. I believe in the power of cultural enrichment
  to fuel human development, especially during early stages, providing individuals with a
  solid foundation and core values that empower their future growth.</p>

<p>Hobbies: I enjoy working on projects with my children, practicing pilates, studying history and prehistory, and engaging in a range of art projects, including drawing, sewing, embroidery, painting, and playing bass. Connecting brings me joy, as does sharing the richness of life with purpose, gratitude, and compassion. </p>
