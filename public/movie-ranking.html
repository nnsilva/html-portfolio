<h1>Best Movies Ever</h1>
<h2>For now</h2>
<hr />

<ul>
<ol><h3>1st The Hobbit</h3>
<p>No fantasy movie is deeper than The Hobbit.</p>

<h3>2nd Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Is the second better, but here I refer to the whole trilogy, in order.</p>

<h3>3rd Butterfly Effect</h3>
<p>The kind of movie that makes you think about each action we do, including when to stop or to insist in some cases, or even just let things go.â€‹</p></ol></ul>
